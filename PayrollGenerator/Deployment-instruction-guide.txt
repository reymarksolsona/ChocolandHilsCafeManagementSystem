We use Hangfire and Topshelf nuget package to run the payroll generator on the background
we cannot include this program or process in our main winform application, because we need this process
to run even if the main application is closed.

We need to separate this program.

to deploy this, you need to copy the net5.0 folder to client computer folder (we just need to copy the program files manually)

Go to ChocolandHilsCafeManagementSystem\PayrollGenerator\bin\Debug

Copy net5.0 to any folder you want

then open cmd.exe and go to the net5.0 folder in client computer (the folder you paste the net5.0)
ex on cmd.exe:
	cd D:/ChocolandHilsCafeMS/PayrollGenerator/net5.0
	then run: 
		> PayrollGenerator.exe install ---> to install the application as service
	go to Windows Services to verify the installation, you should see this PayrollGeneratorBackgroundService as service
	
	to uninstall the service
		> PayrollGenerator.exe uninstall
