Product ingredient cost computation process:

On ingredient Inventory, we can add multiple inventory in single ingredient
for example, the Chocoland hills purchase new stock for certain ingredient on 
different days with different price and expiration date
he/she can add 

UOM is Unit Of Measurement example: kg, grams, Liter, ml, pcs

Product name: Bangus:
	First Purchase 
		UOM: 5kg
		Price: 250/kg
		Expiration Date: (we can say, 4 days only upon purchase) Apr. 2 on purchase date, so we can add expiration date Apr. 6, 2021
		
	Second Purchase:
		Qty: 10kg
		Price: 260/kg
		Expiration Date: Apr. 3 on purchase date, so we can add expiration date Apr. 7, 2021
		
On Product inventory in computing cost on each ingredient:
	
Product: Sinigang na bangus per order
	Ingredient: Bangus
	UOM: 500grams
	
The system will always deduct from stock based on expiration date,
based on Bangus stocks inventory record, the system will deduct the 500grams from first purchase.

if for example, on the first purchase transaction, we only have 1kg of bangus and the order needs 2kg
the system will use the last 1kg from first purchase and the 1kg from second purchase,
the will automatically use the price from separate purchase.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Computation:
	1kg is 250, per gram is 250 / 1000 = 0.25
	
	500grams on 1 order: 500grams * 0.25 = 125pesos
	
	same with liter and ml computation:
	
	1L is 300, per ml is 300 / 1000 = 0.3
	
	250ml on 1 order: 250ml * 0.3 = 75pesos
	
	
if the selected UOM is per kg:
	1kg is 250
